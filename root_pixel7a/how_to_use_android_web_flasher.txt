HOW TO FLASH A NEW ANDROID BUILD USING THE ANDROID WEB FLASHER
===============================================================

This guide will walk you through installing a clean Android build using the official
Android Web Flashing Tool. This process works for Pixel devices and requires a computer
with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- A supported Android device (Pixel recommended)
- OEM Unlocking enabled in Developer Options
- Bootloader already unlocked
- USB cable for data transfer
- Chrome or Edge browser on your computer

STEP 1: Open the Web Flasher
----------------------------
1. On your computer, open this URL in Chrome or Edge:
   https://flash.android.com

2. Click "Get Started"

3. Allow the site to access ADB if prompted.

STEP 2: Connect Your Device
---------------------------
1. Put your phone into bootloader mode:
   You can use ADB:
   adb reboot bootloader

2. On the Web Flasher, click “Add new device”
3. Select your device from the list, then click "Connect"

STEP 3: Choose Your Build
-------------------------
1. Once your device is connected, click "Select a build"
2. Choose the latest public or beta build available for your device
3. Make sure the selected build matches your device model

STEP 4: Enable Advanced Options (IMPORTANT)
-------------------------------------------
Click “More options” to expand advanced settings:

- UNCHECK "Lock bootloader after installation" (IMPORTANT if you plan to root later)
- (Optional) CHECK "Force Flash All Partitions" for a clean install
- Keep "Wipe" checked if you want a fresh reset

STEP 5: Begin Flashing
----------------------
Click “Install Build” and let the process complete.

- Do not unplug your phone
- The process may take several minutes
- Your phone will automatically reboot after flashing

STEP 6: Setup After Flash
-------------------------
- Complete Android setup
- Re-enable Developer Options and USB Debugging
- You're now ready to root or use your device as-is

NOTES:
------
- Flashing a new build will erase all data unless you explicitly uncheck the wipe option.
- Use the web flasher only with a fully charged battery and reliable USB connection.
- If anything fails, restart both your phone and browser, and retry.
