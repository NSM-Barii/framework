HOW TO ROOT AN ANDROID DEVICE USING MAGISK
==========================================

This guide explains how to root your Android device using Magisk,
including cases where your device uses 'init_boot.img' instead of 'boot.img'.

REQUIREMENTS:
- ADB and Fastboot installed
- Bootloader unlocked
- USB Debugging and OEM Unlock enabled

STEP 1: Download Factory Image
------------------------------
- Go to: https://developers.google.com/android/images
- Find your device and download the image that matches your build number
- Extract the zip file

STEP 2: Identify Which Image to Patch
-------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:
- If your factory image has 'init_boot.img', USE THAT — even if 'boot.img' is also present.
- Only if there is NO 'init_boot.img' should you use 'boot.img'.
- Only patch one. Do NOT patch both.

STEP 3: Patch the Image with Magisk
-----------------------------------
1. Transfer the correct image to your phone:
   adb push init_boot.img /sdcard/Download/
   or
   adb push boot.img /sdcard/Download/

2. Install the Magisk APK from:
   https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases

3. Open Magisk on your phone:
   - Tap Install
   - Tap "Select and Patch a File"
   - Choose the image you pushed

4. Magisk will create a new file in your Downloads folder:
   /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched-XXXXX.img

5. Pull the patched image back to your PC:
   adb pull /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched-XXXXX.img

STEP 4: Flash the Patched Image
-------------------------------
1. Reboot to bootloader:
   adb reboot bootloader

2. Flash the image:

   If you patched init_boot.img:
       fastboot flash init_boot magisk_patched.img

   If you patched boot.img:
       fastboot flash boot magisk_patched.img

3. Reboot the phone:
   fastboot reboot

STEP 5: Confirm Root Access
---------------------------
1. Open the Magisk app and confirm it says "Installed"
2. In terminal on your PC:
   adb shell
   su
   whoami

   If you see "root" — you are successfully rooted.

NOTES:
------
- If 'su' is not found, you likely flashed the wrong image or Magisk failed to patch it.
- Do not try to flash both boot.img and init_boot.img.
- Most newer Android 13+ devices (e.g. Pixel 7, Pixel 8) use init_boot.img for rooting.
