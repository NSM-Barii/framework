HOW TO ENABLE OEM UNLOCK AND USB DEBUGGING ON ANDROID
======================================================

1. Enable Developer Options
---------------------------
- Open the **Settings** app on your Android device.
- Scroll down and tap **About phone**.
- Find the **Build number** entry.
- Tap **Build number** 7 times. You may be asked to enter your device PIN/password.
- You should see a message: "You are now a developer!"

2. Enable OEM Unlocking
------------------------
- Go back to the **main Settings** menu.
- Tap **System** > **Developer options** (or just **Developer options**, depending on the Android version).
- Find and enable **OEM unlocking**.
- Confirm when prompted. This allows the bootloader to be unlocked.

**Note:** Enabling OEM Unlocking does *not* unlock the bootloader. It just *permits* it.

3. Enable USB Debugging
------------------------
- In the same **Developer options** menu, find and enable **USB debugging**.
- Confirm the prompt.

4. Trust the Debugging Host (Your PC)
-------------------------------------
- Connect your phone to your computer via USB.
- On your phone, a prompt should appear: **"Allow USB debugging?"**
- Check **Always allow from this computer** and tap **Allow**.

You’re now ready to use ADB and fastboot commands with your device.
