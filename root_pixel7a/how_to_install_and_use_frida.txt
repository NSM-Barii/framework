   Example:

   Make sure the version matches your PC's frida version.

3. Extract it:
   unxz frida-server-17.2.1-android-arm64.xz

STEP 3: Push Frida Server to Your Device
----------------------------------------

STEP 4: Confirm Frida is Working
--------------------------------
On your PC, run:

If you see a list of running processes, Frida is working.

STEP 5: Attach to an App or Inject a Script
-------------------------------------------
To attach to a running app:
   frida -U -n com.example.app

To start an app with Frida:
   frida -U -f com.example.app

To inject a script (e.g., for SSL pinning bypass):
   frida -U -n com.example.app -l bypass.js --no-pause

NOTES:
------
- You must run frida-server as root for it to work
- If it fails to bind or attach, reboot your device and try again
- Scripts can be found online or written using Frida’s API

You now have full runtime control of Android apps — ready for testing, reversing, or debugging.
